# CVE-2021-44733: Fuzzing and exploitation of a use-after-free in the Linux kernel TEE subsystem

Recently a use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the Linux kernel TEE subsystem, up to and including version 5.15.11, and was assigned CVE-2021-44733 [1].

At a first glance it did not seem to be exploitable for several reasons, however after some further analysis of the vulnerable code path and by implementing a crude proof-of-concept exploit it was possible to overwrite a function pointer in the kernel. No privilege escalation payload is presented in this post, however the entire environment for running OPTEE and the exploit is available for further testing, see 'Setting up the environment'.

## Background

A TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is a trusted OS running in some secure environment, for example, TrustZone on ARM CPUs. A TEE driver handles the details needed to communicate with the TEE. Some of the more important duties of the driver is to provide a generic API towards the TEE based on the Globalplatform TEE Client API specification [3], but also to manage the shared memory between Linux and the TEE. This subsystem can be enabled by configuring `CONFIG_OPTEE` in the kernel configurations for ARM architectures.

The secure world contains the trusted OS denoted OP-TEE OS [4]. On top of this OS it is possible to have so called Trusted Applications (TAs) running which can perform some operations in the isolated environment, see Figure 1.

      </br><em>Figure 1: Overview of TEE - from Linaros presentation [5]</em>
</p>

The normal world (Linux userspace/kernel) can interact with these applications using client applications (CAs) and the API exposed by the TEE subsystem. A CA can open a session towards a specific TA and invoke functions that the TA implements. Passing of any arguments back and forth between the TA and CA is done using shared memory.
The interaction between a CA and TA using all relevant syscalls is described next.

1. A CA opens up `/dev/tee[0-9]` to communicate with the driver. Note, that for the conventional way of using these APIs, this is done implicitly using the libteec.

2. The shared memory can be registered by the CA using the `IOCTL TEE_IOC_SHM_ALLOC`. This allocates shared memory and returns a file descriptor which user space can use as part of mmap.

3. The next step is to establish a session using the `IOCTL TEE_IOC_OPEN_SESSION` and specifying the uuid for a specific TA. This uuid is hardcoded during the compilation of the TA.

4. In order to invoke any specific function in the TA, the CA invokes this by specifying the identifier of a function along with any input arguments, this is done using `TEE_IOC_INVOKE`.

5. When the CA is finished with all requests, the session can be closed using `TEE_IOC_CLOSE_SESSION`.

</p>

Much of the communication between clients and the TEE is opaque to the driver. The main job for the driver is to manage the context, receive requests from the clients, forward them to the TEE and send back the results [2].

## Fuzzing of the TEE driver
CVE-2021-44733 was discovered using fuzzing with syzkaller. The description file used for this is provided below. Note that `ioctl$TEE_SHM_REGISTER_FD` is only part of Linaros (maintainers) kernel tree and not in upstream. The environment provided in 'Setting up the environment' could be used for fuzzing if configured properly according to syzkaller documentation [6]

This was triggered by closing all file descriptors from `TEE_IOC_SHM_ALLOC` while a different thread opens a session towards in our case, a non-existing TA. Syzkaller managed to reproduce it and by experimenting with the reproducer code and slightly delaying the call to `TEE_IOC_OPEN_SESSION`, a different UAF occurred for an object belonging to the kmalloc-64 cache:

```
This vulnerability was discovered by fuzzing the TEE driver without any session being established with an existing TA running on the system. This could be further extended with so called pseudo syscalls in syzkaller in order to setup and initiate a session towards some TA.

## Root cause analysis
The conclusion is a design issue with the lifetime tracking of a `tee_shm:dmabuf` object. The driver is designed to let userspace keep the one-and-only reference count after a call to `tee_ioctl_shm_alloc()`.

It is assumed that if the object still is found the driver’s IDR object, then the reference to the dmabuf is still valid and its reference count can be incremented. It turns out this is only partially true. The dmabuf memory is still owned by the dmabuf driver, but it may be in the process of being destroyed and that cannot be stopped by making the reference count non-zero again.

The scenario that triggers the problem is a multi-threaded application where one thread closes the dmabuf file-descriptor at the same time that another thread makes a call to the IOCTL command `TEE_IOC_OPEN_SESSION` or `TEE_IOC_INVOKE` referencing that shared memory.

Tracing the destruction of the dmabuf when user-space closes the fd will run this code in the kernel:

1. `fput()`

2. `fput_many()`  >> File reference count reaches zero. Race window opens.

3. `[task_work gets scheduled]`

4. `__fput`

5. `dput`

6. `dma_buf_release`

7. `tee_shm_release`

     8. `mutex_lock(teedev->mutex)`

     9. `idr_remove(teedev->idr, shm->id)` >> Now the shm object can no longer be referenced from userspace. Race window closes.

     10. `mutex_unlock()`
  
This means that the IDR table  and its mutex lock cannot guarantee that the dmabuf and corresponding `tee_shm` is still alive. A process racing `fput()` by calling `tee_shm_get_from_id()` can get a reference to a shm that is about to go dead.

```
/**
 * tee_shm_get_from_id() - Find shared memory object and increase reference
 * count
 * @ctx:    Context owning the shared memory
 * @id:     Id of shared memory object
 * @returns a pointer to 'struct tee_shm' on success or an ERR_PTR on failure
 */
struct tee_shm *tee_shm_get_from_id(struct tee_context *ctx, int id)
{
    struct tee_device *teedev;
    struct tee_shm *shm;
 
    if (!ctx)
        return ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);
 
    teedev = ctx->teedev;
    mutex_lock(&teedev->mutex);
    shm = idr_find(&teedev->idr, id);
    if (!shm || shm->ctx != ctx)
        shm = ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);
    else if (shm->flags & TEE_SHM_DMA_BUF)
        get_dma_buf(shm->dmabuf);
    mutex_unlock(&teedev->mutex);
    return shm;
}
```

## Exploiting the UAF
In order to exploit this, a reallocation must be made after the object has been free'd and before triggering the UAF. After the call to `tee_shm_get_from_id()`, the function `tee_shm_put()` (for which the second UAF crash from syzkaller occurs) is called which dereferences the tee_shm:dmabuf object used as input argument to `dma_buf_put()`.

```

 * tee_shm_put() - Decrease reference count on a shared memory handle
 * @shm:    Shared memory handle
 */
void tee_shm_put(struct tee_shm *shm)
{
    if (shm->flags & TEE_SHM_DMA_BUF)
        dma_buf_put(shm->dmabuf);
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(tee_shm_put);
```
The shm object could be reallocated before the UAF as it belongs to the kmalloc-64 cache. It would have to be reallocated with:

1. fake `tee_shm`, `tee_shm:dmabuf`, `dma_buf:file` objects 
2. set `file->f_count = 1`
3. craft a `file:file_operations` object that has the `fasync` function pointer set to an arbitrary address

This function is then invoked in `__fput()` after the call to `dma_buf_put()` when `file->f_count` reaches zero. 

PAN (Privileged Access Never) mitigates this as fake objects must be referenced in userspace memory in order to set an arbitrary function pointer in the `file:f_ops` structure. Therefore `CONFIG_CPU_SW_DOMAIN_PAN` must be disabled for this to work which it is in the provided environment. There are some open questions left as whether PAN can be bypassed in this vulnerability, e.g., using ret2dir. 

Also, in order to perform a successful reallocation of the free'd shm object, the IOCTL call `TEE_IOC_OPEN_SESSION` or `TEE_IOC_INVOKE` must be preemted by a thread performing the file descriptor close and heap spraying thread that fills the kmalloc-64 cache. For this to work the kernel must be configured with `CONFIG_PREEMPT`. In this PoC the heap spray from Nicolas Fabretti's blog post [7] was utilized based on blocking `sendmsg()`. 

To summarize, the issue in regards to exploitation is that both the free and UAF must occur within the same system call. In addition to this, freeing is hard to trigger as it is requires racing within the syscall. After freeing, the time between it and the actual UAF is a small time window where a heap spray must be performed to reallocate the free'd object. Further, the shm object is being destroyed so we need to rely on overwriting some function pointer in the `file_operations` structure. The following Figure shows the threads involved in the exploit code and their role.

       </br><em>Figure 3: Threads involved in the exploit code</em>
</p>

  
Three type of threads are running continuously. In order to preempt the system calling thread, it is running with the lowest possible priority, `SCHED_IDLE` while the others have the priority set to `SCHED_OTHER`. Because we are using blocking `sendmsg()`, each spray attempt must run in its own thread and it must run on the same CPU core that triggers the UAF since each core keeps their own kmalloc caches. There are also a number of freeing threads that close the file descriptor from the shared memory allocation in step 1b). Full source code for this UAF trigger and function pointer overwrite can be found at [10].

## Setting up the new environment
To reproduce the environment with a vulnerable kernel and OPTEE, it can be cloned from the following repository and built using:

```
$ mkdir optee-qemu && cd optee-qemu
$ repo init -u https://github.com/pjlantz/optee-qemu.git
$ repo sync
$ cd build
$ make toolchains -j2
$ make run
```
After successful build, it will spawn three consoles, one for QEMU - press 'c' in the QEMU console in order to boot. A second console shows output from the secure world and the final one will boot into Linux. Login as root (no password).

Run the exploit code until the `fasync` function pointer of the `file_operations` structure is set to `0x22000000`. 

```
until optee_exploit | grep "0x22000000" /var/log/messages; do sleep 0.01; done
```

This will stop due to Privileged execute-never (PXN) blocking the execution at `PC=0x22000000`. From here on, exploitation strategies can vary depending on the kernel version, but it might be possible to execute a kernel ROP and do stack pivoting, or make vDSO area writable and place the payload there. It might also be interesting for future work to investigate whether PAN can be bypassed using ret2dir and some physmap spraying. PAN can be enabled in the kernel by setting `CONFIG_CPU_SW_DOMAIN_PAN=y` in `linux/.config`. On real hardware, it is enabled by default on ARMv8.1 and AArch64, for ARMv7 and AArch32 it is possible to have software emulated PAN using this setting [8]. 

**Note**: This exploit is not very well optimized and may occasionally hang the driver if it manage to free the shm object too early, in this case PC will be at `tee_shm_get_from_id()`. If this happens, issue a `system_reset` in the QEMU console to reboot the environment.
